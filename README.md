# ArduinoCipherYear1Project

This file is one of the first ever things i have coded. 
Similar to Morse Code, "SA code" allows the user to comunicate in a slightly encrypted manor.
The project allows the user to translate the code both ways and see the SA code flashed on the arduino.

In a redesign I would improve upon the code by making use of structs and a map data structure.
